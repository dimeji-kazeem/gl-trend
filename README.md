## Introduction

Time series analysis is a powerful technique used to analyze data points collected over time. This repository provides code examples to perform time series analysis on transaction data, including preprocessing the data, visualizing the time series, and decomposing it into its trend, seasonal, and residual components.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can clone this repository and install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/time-series-analysis.git
cd time-series-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dependencies
pandas
matplotlib
statsmodels
You can install the required dependencies using the provided requirements.txt file by running the command pip install -r requirements.txt.

Usage
Prepare your transaction data in a CSV format and replace 'your_data.csv' in the code with your data file's path.

Run the code using Jupyter Notebook or any other Python environment.

The code performs data preprocessing, visualizes the time series, and displays the seasonal decomposition components.

Results
The code generates visualizations of the time series data, as well as plots for the trend, seasonal, and residual components obtained from seasonal decomposition. Additionally, it provides insights into the patterns and trends within the data.

Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to create issues or submit pull requests.
